# Phase 0 Rules (enforced in this repo)
- Scope is Phase 0 only: scorecard, storage round-trip, tests, CI, lint/type infrastructure.
- Do NOT add external services, feeds, LLM calls, or network code.
- All edits must keep ruff, mypy, and pytest passing.
- Maintain deterministic behavior; do not introduce randomness outside explicit synthetic data generation.
- Prefer small, verifiable changes. If a change affects public interfaces (schemas, CLI), write or update tests first.
